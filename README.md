# Newspack Teams for WooCommerce Memberships Access by IP

This Plugin is an extension for the [Teams for WooCommerce Memberships](https://woocommerce.com/products/teams-woocommerce-memberships/) plugin.

It enables public access to specific Team Membership's content to requests based on request Client's IP address.

## Usage

The plugin adds a simple settings Section to the `WooCommerce` > `Settings` > `Memberships`, called "Team Access by IP".

These settings allow the site admin to enter IPv4 addresses and/or IPv4 address ranges for all existing Team Memberships. 

For browser requests coming from those IP addresses, it enables public viewing (no login or registration needed) of all the Posts which that particular Team Membership Plan is able to view.
