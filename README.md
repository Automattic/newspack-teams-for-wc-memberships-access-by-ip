# Newspack Teams for WooCommerce Memberships Access by IP

This Plugin is an extension for the [Teams for WooCommerce Memberships](https://woocommerce.com/products/teams-woocommerce-memberships/) plugin.

It enables public access to normally restricted Team Membership's content, based on the IP address of the client request.

## Usage

This plugin adds a simple settings Section to the `WooCommerce` > `Settings` > `Memberships`, called "Team Access by IP".

In those settings, you can associate custom IPv4 addresses and/or IPv4 address ranges to any existing Team Membership. 

For browser requests coming from those IP addresses, it enables public viewing of all the Posts (no login or registration needed) which that particular Team Membership is able to view based on their Membership Plan settings.
